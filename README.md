Template Extraction from Unstructured Text
This project uses Natural Language Processing techniques to automatically extract templates from unstructured text documents.

Problem Statement
Unstructured text documents often contain repeated patterns and structures that can be extracted into reusable templates. This project aims to identify these implicit templates and extract them from input text data.

Data
The data for this project consists of unstructured text documents in various domains like:

Emails
Product descriptions
News articles
Social media posts

Methods
The following NLP methods are used:

Topic modeling to identify common themes across documents
Pattern detection to find repeating lexical patterns, phrases and structures
Text segmentation to split documents into coherent segments
Sequence alignment to align segments into template structures
Template merging to combine similar templates

Usage
To extract templates from input text data:

Import the TemplateExtractor class
Initialize the model by passing in a list of input text documents
Call the extract_templates() method:

    from template_extractor import TemplateExtractor
    # Initialize model
    model = TemplateExtractor(input_docs)
    # Extract templates
    templates = model.extract_templates() 

The templates will contain a list of extracted templates from across the input documents.

Future Work
Improve sequence alignment model to handle more complex template structures
Refine pattern detection to identify implicit patterns more accurately
Develop better methods for merging and consolidating similar templates
Expand to more types of unstructured text data and domains
